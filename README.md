🚀 Running the Pipeline
1. Open the Project in RStudio

    Launch RStudio
    In the bottom-right file explorer:
        Navigate to: treescan_project/code/
        Open: run_full_pipeline.R

2. Configure the Script

Before running, update the following:
Set Working Directory

Update line 4 to match your local path:

setwd("~/TreeScan-implementation/treescan_project")

Replace with wherever you saved treescan_project.
Set Execution Mode

Modify these variables depending on your setup:

server <- FALSE      # Set to TRUE if running on a server
first_time <- TRUE   # Set to FALSE after first run

3. Run the Pipeline

    Run the script in RStudio

The pipeline will:

    Execute TreeScan
    Process outputs
    Complete the full analysis workflow

⚠️ Notes

    Ensure the correct TreeScan version is placed in the matching folder (TS_windows or TS_linux)
    Using the non-graphical version is required
    Incorrect working directory paths will cause errors
